              <h2>My Background</h2>
              <p>Family is the most important thing to me. I have a brother his name is <span class="fam">Ryan</span>.  <span class="fam">Ryan</span> has a degree in computer science and is one of the people that first introduced me to coding.  As I say that, I realize my father worked in the computer industry as well. My fathers name is <span class="fam">Chuck</span></a>.  <span class="fam">Chuck</span>
             use to work on backend development, and growing up he was always the tech guy of the family. Now that I've been developing my skills as a programmer I see how my father thinks about problems and why<span class="fam">Chuck</span> doesn't care if he doesn't know, because he knows how to know.

                <p>
                  I'm interested in learning python at some point in the future. However, right now my number 1 focus is the day-to-day grind at epicodus.  <strong><em>Loving every minute of it.</em></strong>
                </p>
              <li class="SFF">Hobbies</li>
                <p>In my free time I enjoy supporting my favorite sports teams. I really like the Seattle Sounders, the Seattle Mariners, and the Seattle Seahawks.  Can you guess where I am from?
                </p>
              <li class="SFF">Skills</li>
                <P>
                  So far in epicodus I have been developing my html skills as well as using github and css files for styling.  I like that because it gives the structure the webpage a nice professional layout before going in and doing any other fancy things.  I'm very proud of the soft skills I am developing here at epicodus.  Everyone seems very nice and goal oriented.  I've learned a lot from the students that have more experience than me. Pair programming rocks!
